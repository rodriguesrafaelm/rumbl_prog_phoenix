# Programming Phoenix
Currently reading Programming Phoenix book to learn more about this elixir framework. <br>
This application is from the book and its used to teach some important aspects of Phoenix.<br>
I'm still reading the book so its still incomplete.


# Rumbl

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
